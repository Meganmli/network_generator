# network_generator
Creates a network of mouse gene interactions represented by their orthologous human genes interactions

## Set-up & Requirements
1. Install requirements from requirements.txt
2. If `./data/publications.csv` is absent, run `prep_work.py` to generate it. This is a one-time call to format all publication counts for each human gene.
